# Superhero Name Generator
This is a web deployment of guided project <a href="https://github.com/avishek-018/single_notebook_projects/tree/main/Superhero-Name-Generator"> Create a Superhero Name Generator with TensorFlow</a>.
The developed system is based on deep learning sequence generation. We created a character level language model that will predict the next character for a given input sequence. To get a new predicted superhero name, we'll need to give our model a seed input, which can be a single character or a sequence of characters, and the model will then produce the next character it thinks should come after the input sequence.This character is then added to the seed input to create a new input, which is then used again to generate the next character, and so on.

### Usage:

Give one or two starting letters of your desired superhero name. The name will be generated by the system.<br>
<b>Example Input:</b> av<br>
<b>Possible Output:</b> aven stark
